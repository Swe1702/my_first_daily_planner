# my_first_daily_planner

Daily Scheduler is a simple web application that allows users to create a daily schedule by planning events for each hour of the day. It saves events to the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist even after the browser is closed.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DayJS - A modern JavaScript date utility library

## Usage

When you open the Daily Scheduler in your web browser, you will see a list of time blocks representing standard business hours (9AM to 5PM). Each time block contains:

- A text area for writing an event or task
- A save button for saving the event to the browser's local storage

By clicking and typing in the text area, you can plan your daily activities. To save the event, click the save button.

The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page. The color of each time block will change depending on the current time:

- Past hours will be gray
- Current hour will be red
- Future hours will be green

Events saved to local storage will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.
